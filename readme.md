## Python script to scrape a website and save the data into a text file

1 - Install Python: To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

2 - Install required libraries: This script requires the requests and beautifulsoup4 libraries. To install these libraries, you can use pip, which is a package manager for Python. Open the command prompt or terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

Update the URL: Replace the url variable in the script with the URL of the website you want to scrape.

3 - Update the headers: If you want to send headers with a different user agent or other custom headers, you can modify the headers dictionary in the script.

4 - Run the script: Open the command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where the script is saved, and enter the following command:

```bash
python scraping_script.py
```

This will run the script and scrape the website. The scraped data will be saved into a text file named scraped_data.txt in the same directory as the script.
